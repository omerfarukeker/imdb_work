Exploratory analysis on the IMDB movie database

Following Python codes generates some exploratory graphs to see the correlation between movie features. The IMDB movie database can be downloaded from the link below:
https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

The link also gives a description of the data.

I downloaded all .tsv files from the link and used all except "title.episode.tsv.gz" which has TV series data.

All .tsv files are imported into a SQLite database file (~4GB) and stored in the hardware. Python code are querying the necessary parts of the SQLite database and processing & visualising some interesting results. Resulting graphs are also added in this repository.

I am looking forward to continue to work on this data as I am passionate about movies and data science. Recommendations are welcomed.

Cheers!
